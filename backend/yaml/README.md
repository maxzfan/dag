# Generated YAML Files

This directory contains all AI agent configurations generated by the journal system.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named with the pattern: `agent-{timestamp}.yaml`

Where `{timestamp}` is in ISO format: `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`

Example: `agent-20231215T143022Z.yaml`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /yaml-files` - List all generated YAML files with metadata
- `GET /yaml-files/{filename}` - Download a specific YAML file
- `DELETE /yaml-files/{filename}` - Delete a specific YAML file

## File Structure

Each YAML file contains a complete Fetch.ai agent configuration that can be deployed directly.

## Automatic Generation

YAML files are automatically generated when:
1. A problem is detected in journal entries
2. The problem meets automation criteria
3. User confirms deployment

The system will save the YAML file and provide the path for reference.
